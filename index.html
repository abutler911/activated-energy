            <p>
              AXIO is a brain performance product that gives you long-lasting
              energy without the crash from sugary beverages and snacks. The
              ingredients for both AXIO and AXIO Decaf were chosen to ignite
              long- lasting power, heightened concentration and sharper focus
              without the stressful jitters often experienced with energy
              supplements.

              <h3>More Energy</h3>
              <p>
                Energy. Concentration. Focus. We all want more of these to meet
                the demands of our busy world. Our circadian rhythm naturally
                drops our energy mid- morning and mid-afternoon but who has time
                to stop and take a nap? We’re all busy working, running errands,
                racing to our next class, or picking up kids from school and
                taking them to their evening activities. You don’t have any
                extra time in your day but you need the energy to power through
                your schedule. Sugary beverages and snacks or excessive energy
                supplements are easy to find but they come with a crash—they’re
                not the answer.

              <h3>Convenience</h3>
              <p>
                Easy-to-reach store shelves are lined with sugary beverages and
                highly processed snacks that contain unnecessarily high amounts
                of calories, sugar, fat, sodium and caffeine. They promise us a
                spike in energy followed by a crash once the sugar wears off.
                Most energy drink supplements come with higher doses of
                caffeine, sugar, and calories than we need in one
                serving—feeding a harmful cycle. Every crash forces us to reach
                for another quick-fix sugar boost or energy drink, and the
                vicious cycle continues. This pattern simply isn’t sustainable!

              <h3>Fuel With Smart Energy</h3>
              <p>
                AXIO and AXIO Decaf eliminate the need to reach for sugary
                drinks or unnecessary calorie-laden snacks to give you the boost
                you need. Sugary energy supplements, drinks and snacks set you
                up for a crash—AXIO doesn’t. Reach for AXIO instead—a zero-
                sugar boost of energy that uses vitamins, minerals and
                phytonutrients to give you long-lasting power. Whether you sit
                for an 8+ hour work day or need a boost while running errands
                around town, AXIO can provide the energy, concentration and
                focus you need to get through your day.
